# MACCS_Fingerprinting
MACCS (Molecular ACCess System) fingerprinting is a widely used method in cheminformatics for representing molecular structures as binary vectors. These fingerprints are primarily employed in tasks like molecular similarity searches, clustering, and quantitative structureâ€“activity relationship (QSAR) modelling.

Key Features:

Structure: MACCS fingerprints consist of a fixed-length bit vector, commonly 166 bits, where each bit corresponds to the presence (1) or absence (0) of a specific predefined structural key or substructure in the molecule.

Predefined Keys: The 166 structural keys encode specific chemical features (e.g., presence of an aromatic ring, halogen atom, or carboxylic acid group). These keys are hand-crafted and represent expert-defined substructures.

Simplicity and Speed: Due to their fixed size and predefined nature, MACCS fingerprints are computationally efficient and easy to compare using metrics like the Tanimoto (Jaccard) similarity coefficient.

Limitations: While fast and interpretable, MACCS fingerprints may miss subtle or complex structural nuances, as they do not capture 3D conformations or stereochemistry and are limited to the predefined substructures.

Applications:

Virtual screening

Molecular similarity and clustering

Drug discovery pipelines

QSAR modelling and prediction
